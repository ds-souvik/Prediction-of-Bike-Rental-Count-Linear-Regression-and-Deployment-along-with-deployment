<center><h1>Boom-Bikes Bike Rentals.</h1></center>

<p>A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They also want to expand their business outside US. Hence they want their potential partners to forecast the number of bikes rented by customers in various conditions.</p>

<center><h1>Business Goal.</h1></center>
<p>The objective of this project is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management and potential partners to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. </p>
